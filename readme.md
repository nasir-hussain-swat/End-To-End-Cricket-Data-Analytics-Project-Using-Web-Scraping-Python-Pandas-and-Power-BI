# Cricket T20 World Cup (2022) Data Analytics Project

Welcome to the Cricket T20 World Cup (2022) Data Analytics Project! This project is designed for both beginners and advanced users, offering an end-to-end data analysis experience. We have utilized data from the T20 World Cup 2022 to create insights and assemble the best 11-player team that could potentially compete against aliens.

## Project Overview

In this project, we cover the following key steps:

1. **Data Collection**: We've gathered data from the T20 World Cup 2022 using Bright Data web scraping techniques. Our data source is ESPNcricinfo.

2. **Data Transformation and Cleaning**: Once the data was collected, we performed necessary data transformations and cleaning using the powerful pandas library in Python. This step ensures that the data is in the right format for analysis.

3. **Insights Generation**: With the cleaned data, we delve into generating insights about the best 11 players that could represent Earth in a match against aliens. This involves statistical analysis and decision-making.

4. **Dashboard Creation**: To present our findings and insights, we've created interactive dashboards using Power BI. These visualizations make it easy to understand and share the results with others.
